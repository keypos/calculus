    <h1>Differentiation</h1>
    <p>Mathematics Help Sheet</p>
    <p><strong>The University of Sydney Business School</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Differentiation is a branch of calculus that involves finding the rate of change of one variable with respect to another variable. In practice, this commonly involves finding the rate of change of a curve (generally a two-variate function that can be represented on a Cartesian plane).</p>
    <p>You differentiate a function in order to find its derivative, which is a measure of how that function (the output)
    changes as its input(s) change(s).</p>
    <p>A useful concept in differentiation is the tangent which is a straight line that just touches a curve at any given point. The slope of a tangent at any point is the measure of the rate of change of a curve at that particular point.</p>

    <h2>Differentiation Notation</h2>
    <p>When given a variable (<em>y</em>) expressed as a function of another variable (<em>x</em>) such that <em>y = f(x)</em>, we can differentiate <em>y</em> with respect to <em>x</em>. In terms of mathematical notation, the derivative (or the first derivative) of the general function <em>y = f(x)</em> can be expressed as:</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>dy/dx</code> or <code>d/dx y</code> or <code>f'(x)</code> or <code>d/dx f(x)</code> or <code>y'</code></p>
    <p>It is important to note that <code>dy/dx</code> does not represent a fraction such that you can cancel out terms in the numerator or denominator.</p>

    <h2>Differentiation by First Principles</h2>
    <p>A formal statement of differentiation is as follows (in reference to the following graph):</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>f'(x) = lim<sub>h→0</sub> (f(a + h) - f(a)) / h</code></p>
    <p>That is, the first derivative of the function at point x is given by the slope (or the rise over run) of the curve as the distance between the two points (A and B) goes to 0 (i.e. they merge into a single point).</p>

    <h2>Constants</h2>
    <p>The derivative of any constant is simply 0 since the value of the constant never changes. That is,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>d/dx a = 0</code></p>
    <p>Where <em>a</em> is any constant.</p>

    <h2>Polynomial Functions</h2>
    <p>A polynomial function is a function that contains only non-negative integer powers of a variable such as a quadratic or a cubic function, e.g. <em>y = x²</em> and <em>y = 3x³</em>, respectively.</p>
    <p>Where <em>y = axⁿ</em>,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>dy/dx = n * axⁿ⁻¹</code></p>
    <p>That is, the new coefficient is the product of the original exponent and original coefficient, and the new exponent is the original exponent subtracted by 1.</p>
    <p>For example,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>f(x) = 2 + 3x⁵</code></p>
    <p class="equation"><code>f'(x) = 15x⁴</code></p>
    <p>Note that in the preceding example, the constant disappears after differentiation, since the derivative of a constant is always 0.</p>

    <h2>Exponential Functions</h2>
    <p>An exponential function possesses a value that is raised to the power which is or contains the variable of interest, that is, it possesses the general form <em>y = ax</em>. Where the base value is the constant “e”, there are special rules which exist for differentiating exponential functions.</p>
    <p>Where <em>y = e<sup>f(x)</sup></em>,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>dy/dx = f'(x) * e<sup>f(x)</sup></code></p>
    <p>That is, the derivative of the exponent becomes the new coefficient of “e”, and the original expression with base “e” remains the same.</p>
    <p>For example,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>y = 2e<sup>4x²</sup></code></p>
    <p class="equation"><code>dy/dx = 2(8x)e<sup>4x²</sup></code></p>
    <p class="equation"><code>dy/dx = 16x e<sup>4x²</sup></code></p>
    <p>Note: for an explanation of exponential functions in general, please refer to the “Exponentials and Logarithms” help sheet.</p>

    <h2>Logarithmic Functions</h2>
    <p>A logarithmic function is a function that possesses the general form <em>y = log<sub>a</sub>(x)</em>. When the base of the log is “e”, i.e. we are dealing with <em>ln(f(x))</em>, there are special rules for differentiating logarithmic functions.</p>
    <p>Where <em>y = log<sub>e</sub>(x)</em>,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>dy/dx = f'(x) / f(x)</code></p>
    <p>That is, the derivative of the log consists of:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The derivative of the function within the log to form the numerator, and</li>
        <li>The original log function to form the denominator</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For example,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>y = ln(2x² + 5)</code></p>
    <p class="equation"><code>dy/dx = 4x / (2x² + 5)</code></p>
    <p>A harder example involving both an exponential function and logarithm,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>y = ln(e<sup>2x</sup> + 2)</code></p>
    <p class="equation"><code>dy/dx = 2e<sup>2x</sup> / (e<sup>2x</sup> + 2)</code></p>
    <p>Note: for an explanation of logarithmic functions in general, please refer to the “Exponentials and Logarithms” help sheet.</p>

    <h2>Further Rules</h2>
    <h3>The Chain Rule</h3>
    <p>The Chain rule is used where there is a function within a function. For example, where the functional form is <em>y = G(f(x))</em>,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>dy/dx = G'(f(x)) * f'(x)</code></p>
    <p>The derivative of the above function is a product of the derivative of the inner function (<em>f(x)</em>) and the derivative of the outer function (<em>G(x)</em>).</p>
    <p>For example,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>y = [f(x)]<sup>n</sup></code></p>
    <p class="equation"><code>dy/dx = n * f'(x) * [f(x)]<sup>n-1</sup></code></p>
    <p>For example,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>y = [x²]³</code></p>
    <p class="equation"><code>dy/dx = 3x * [x²]²</code></p>

    <h3>The Product Rule</h3>
    <p>The product rule is used when you need to differentiate the product of two functions. Where <em>y = uv</em>,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>dy/dx = u * v' + v * u'</code></p>
    <p>The derivative is the sum of:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The first term multiplied by the derivative of the second term</li>
        <li>The second term multiplied by the derivative of the first term</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For example,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>y = (x² + 12)(3x³ + x)</code></p>
    <p class="equation"><code>dy/dx = (x² + 12)(9x² + 1) + 2x(3x³ + x)</code></p>

    <h3>The Quotient Rule</h3>
    <p>The quotient rule is used when you have one function divided by another function. Where <em>y = u / v</em>,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>dy/dx = (v * u' - u * v') / v²</code></p>
    <p>The derivative has a numerator which consists:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The denominator of the original function multiplied by the derivative of the numerator of the original function, subtracted by</li>
        <li>The numerator of the original function multiplied by the derivative of the denominator of the original function.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The derivative has a denominator which consists:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The denominator of the original function squared.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For example,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>y = (x³ + 8) / x²</code></p>
    <p class="equation"><code>dy/dx = (x² * 3x² - (x³ + 8) * 2x) / x⁴</code></p>
    <p class="equation"><code>dy/dx = (x³ - 16) / x³</code></p>

    <h2>Finding Maxima and Minima</h2>
    <p>In the Business School, you may be asked to find the maximum profit or minimum cost of a profit function. The easiest and quickest way to do this is to find the derivative of a function, and equate it to zero. This is because at a rate of change of zero, the tangent is horizontal and should correspond to the point where profits have reached their highest, or where costs have reached their lowest.</p>
    <p>Consider for example, a business which has the following profit function,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>π = pq - 10q</code></p>
    <p>Where,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>p = 30 - q</code></p>
    <p>Thus,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>π = (30 - q)q - 10q</code></p>
    <p class="equation"><code>π = 20q - q²</code></p>
    <p>Differentiating profit with respect to quantity,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>dπ/dq = 20 - 2q</code></p>
    <p>Setting the first derivative to zero,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>2q = 20</code></p>
    <p class="equation"><code>q = 10</code></p>
    <p>Thus, the quantity that maximises profit is 10.</p>

    <h2>The Second Derivative</h2>
    <p>To check whether a result is a maximum or a minimum (or neither), you can use the second derivative. To find the second derivative, you simply differentiate the first derivative as you did the original function.</p>
    <p>In the preceding example,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>dπ/dq = 20 - 2q</code></p>
    <p>Differentiating again,</p>
    <p class="equation"><code>d²π/dq² = -2</code></p>
    <p>Thus, the second derivative is negative which indicates a maximum.</p>
    <p>The rules can be summarised as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the second derivative is positive, you have a minimum</li>
        <li>If the second derivative is negative, you have a maximum</li>
        <li>If the second derivative is 0, then you have neither</li>
    </ul>

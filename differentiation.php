A bottle of water was taken out of a fridge on a hot day when the air temperature was 40°C. The graph
y = f (x) above shows how the temperature increased over the next 80 minutes. The horizontal axis gives
the time x in minutes, and the vertical axis gives the temperature y°C.
The water temperature was originally 0°C, and 20 minutes later it was 20°C. Thus during the first
20 minutes, the temperature was rising at an average rate of 1°C per minute. This rate is the gradient of the
chord OA.

<p>
Measuring the instantaneous rate of temperature increase, however, requires a tangent to be drawn. The
gradient of the tangent is the instantaneous rate of increase at the time x — such gradients are easy to
measure on the graph paper by counting little divisions and using the formula gradient = rise
run.

The gradient of the tangent to the curve y = f (x) at any point is called the derivative, which is written as
f ′(x). Measuring the gradients at the marked points O, A, B and C gives a table of values of the derivative:
